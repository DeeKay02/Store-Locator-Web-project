# Store Locator - A Front-end Web Development Project

This was my first ever web development. With guidance of a developer I was able to complete this website.

When you download these files and open it in a browser you may get a Oops! error. That is because the Google API key I have used might have expired. If you want you can enter  your own Google maps API key in the src of the script tag at the end of the HTML code and view it.<br /><br />
